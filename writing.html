For once, I actually have absolutely no direction as to what I want to do and what exactly makes me happy. I guess my whole life, I've just been following the typical path that we're all supposed to take - go to school, graduate, earn some decent grades, and find a job.<br /><br />I feel so completely lost right now, I have no idea what to do.<br /><br />I need to stop hanging on. I need to stop being so sensitive to every little thing. I need to stop being so uncomfortable with this entire situation.<br /><br />But I can't. It's so hard. My personality is not the kind to deal with type of lifestyle. I just want it to all end. I want it to end. To fail. To stop. To stop being a part of my life. I'm so sick of this...and I don't think I've ever been so unhappy before in my life (unless you count the times before going into University). I don't want to become depressed over this, but it's so hard. I don't know what to do anymore.<br /><br />I don't have motivation. I don't have a sense of happiness. I've lost all sense of hope and aspirations. I feel so lost.<br /><br />I'm just really really sad.&nbsp;</div>

				<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><br /><span>&#8203;&ldquo;Okay&hellip;bye mom.&rdquo; As I hung up the phone, I leaned back in my chair and stared at the blank wall before me. This wasn&rsquo;t the first time I ended a conversation with my mom and felt a pang of sadness hit me. This wasn&rsquo;t the first time I felt speechless and overwhelmed by a simple 5 minute call. As usual, I could feel the tears forming in my eyes, and I hastily wiped them away with one hand. &nbsp;</span><br /><span>&nbsp;</span><br /><span>To tell you the truth, I have no idea when things started to change and go downhill. I have no idea when I stopped smiling around my mom and when she stopped smiling around me. But one day, I started to see my reality before me. I started to see that my family is not perfect. I started to see that my family is the furthest thing from being perfect. But worst of all, I started to see my relationship with my mom deteriorate right before my eyes.</span><br /><span>&nbsp;</span><br /><span>When I was younger, I always thought of my dad as the &ldquo;bad guy&rdquo;; he was the one who became easily angered over every little thing, the one who would yell when I brought home a bad grade, and the one who would criticize me for every mistake I made. My mom was a stark contrast: she was the gentle, kind, and soft-voiced parent who was more compassionate than anyone else I knew. She would listen to me with patience and always knew exactly what to say to lift my spirits. She was truly my best friend.</span><br /><span>&nbsp;</span><br /><span>But throughout the years, that all began to change. My mom no longer saw things from my perspective and she no longer understood me in the same way as before. She no longer listened with an open heart and smiled at me when things became rough. Instead, she became easily upset over the little choices I made, and nine out of ten times, our conversations would end in only one way: my mom crying to herself alone for hours. Each time, I would think to myself,&nbsp;</span><em>What did I do wrong?</em><span>&nbsp;I just didn&rsquo;t get it.</span><br /><span>&nbsp;</span><br /><span>I still remember sitting on the stairs that led down to our basement when I was younger. I still remember shaking and covering my ears in an attempt to zone out the shrilling voices of my parents as tears streamed down my face incessantly. That was one of the many arguments my parents used to have. I still remember how badly I wished I had a sibling, right there and then, who could sit beside me and share the agony and fear I was experiencing at 8 years old.</span><br /><span>&nbsp;</span><br /><span>Now, 14 years later, I barely witness them fight anymore. Maybe it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m not home as often or maybe it&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re simply too tired to argue. Despite everything being quieter, it only makes me feel more pained, more frustrated, and more confused. That&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;ve come to realize that the quieter I am, the less upset my mom is. The less I act myself, the better she feels. This isn&rsquo;t the relationship I want to share with her, and this certainly isn&rsquo;t the way I want to spend the rest of my life. I want to things to change and be a better daughter, but at this point, I don&rsquo;t know how. I want my mom to be genuinely happy and excited to see me, but at this point, I honestly don&rsquo;t know how. I want to re-kindle that pure and loving relationship we once shared, but at this point, I honestly just don&rsquo;t know how.</span><br /><span>&nbsp;</span><br /><span>Although already 22, I still long to be 5 years old again. I still long to be young and carefree and ignorant of reality. Although already an adult, I still bury my head under my covers sometimes and just cry big, large tears &ndash; tears that should&rsquo;ve been cried so many years ago &ndash; &nbsp;tears of sadness, of anger, of confusion, and of frustration. These are the tears for my mom&hellip;because despite everything else, I still love her with all my heart.&nbsp;</span></div>

				<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;"><br />&#8203;It&rsquo;s about 11:32am on a Sunday morning, and we&rsquo;re in the middle of climbing up a steep trail that leads to a gorgeous view of the city. The sun beams down on our faces and in the background, a clear turquoise body of water seeps in our reflections as it glitters and shines with the sun. I could feel the scorching heat on my back and the perspiration beginning to form on my forehead. It&rsquo;s the most beautiful place to spend your long-weekend vacation, a time to finally soak in some sunshine &ndash; when suddenly &ndash; ZZZZZ &ndash; &nbsp;Charlie&rsquo;s phone goes off and immediately he stops in his tracks to answer it. I stop beside him and sigh inwardly, and can&rsquo;t help but to crack a small smile as he takes on the urgent call. This is the life of dating a full-fledged entrepreneur.<br />&nbsp;<br />I&rsquo;ve known my boyfriend for about four years now, but it wasn&rsquo;t until a year and a half ago during dinner one night that he looked me in the eye and murmured, &ldquo;Emily, I want to do my own startup.&rdquo; A year and a half ago, I had no idea what those words meant. A year and a half later, I&rsquo;ve grown to understand them all too well. Simply put, my life has been a complete rollercoaster ride ever since. For someone that&rsquo;s absolutely terrified of rollercoasters (go figure), I&rsquo;m proud of myself for having gone through this chapter of my life.<br />&nbsp;<br />But I admit &ndash; it wasn&rsquo;t easy &ndash; and it still isn&rsquo;t. Over this journey, I&rsquo;ve gathered some of my insights on what I&rsquo;ve come to realize:<br />&nbsp;<br />1.&nbsp;<strong>You&rsquo;re always going to miss him</strong><br />There hasn&rsquo;t been one day that goes by where I don&rsquo;t miss Charlie and wish to spend more time with him. It&rsquo;s funny because I typically live with him on weekdays and we&rsquo;re in constant communication when he&rsquo;s not around. But despite all the face time we share, a part of me will always miss him having more flexibility and not being strained by such a demanding work schedule.<br />&nbsp;<br />2.&nbsp;<strong>You&rsquo;ll usually end up sleeping on your own </strong><br />&ldquo;Charlie, I&rsquo;m going to go sleep now&hellip;please don&rsquo;t sleep too late.&rdquo; He turns around and smiles at me, kisses me goodnight, and continues to go back to work. I know my urging of &ldquo;don&rsquo;t sleep too late&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t ever make a difference, but I still say it anyways. I&rsquo;ve gotten used to never expecting him to sleep beside me, and instead falling asleep to the soft glow of his desk lamp and the quiet clicking sounds of his keyboard while he types away into the night.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>3.&nbsp;You&rsquo;ll be involved in a whole new world of things </strong><br />Even today, I don&rsquo;t understand every part of how his business works, and I don&rsquo;t think I ever will or need to for that matter. What I have learned is how the gist of their business functions, being exposed to unfamiliar terms like &ldquo;unicorn companies&rdquo; and &ldquo;series A funding&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ve truly seen a business idea develop from start to finish. It&rsquo;s ridiculous, but you slowly grow to understand it with time.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>4.&nbsp;You&rsquo;ll need to find your own passion</strong><br />I don&rsquo;t think I can stress upon this one enough. When Charlie first started doing a startup, I felt lost and confused with myself because I had so much free time. Here I was, in school and working a regular 9-5 job while he was working 100-hour weeks. It wasn&rsquo;t until after his business developed further that I grew more independent and finally discovered things I wanted in life too &ndash; and moved forward to pursue that.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>5. You&rsquo;ll feel envious from time to time</strong><br />As much as I hate to admit it, this is completely true. It&rsquo;s not that I&rsquo;m envious of his success, but it&rsquo;s that he has always been so sure of exactly what he wanted. Despite his long hours, his stress, and his lack of sleep, at the end of the day, he&rsquo;s working on something he absolutely loves, and that&rsquo;s a rare find in life.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>6.&nbsp;You&rsquo;ll never have guarantees</strong><br />Charlie and I have gotten into countless arguments about this, but never expect things to be the way they seem &ndash; even if they&rsquo;re a &ldquo;promise&rdquo;. In the startup world, nothing is predictable. No matter how hard you try to guarantee something, there&rsquo;s always a chance things will change. Entrepreneurs will always face uncertainties in their life, and that&rsquo;s unfortunately something that&rsquo;s out of their control.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>7.&nbsp;You&rsquo;ll have doubts </strong><br />Especially at the beginning, I found myself doubting my relationship a lot whenever Charlie&rsquo;s startup got in the way. They&rsquo;d be feelings ranging from, &ldquo;Is this really going to work?&rdquo; to &ldquo;Am I even okay with this myself?&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve come to realize that firstly, it&rsquo;s normal to have these doubts &ndash; jumping into a whole new lifestyle isn&rsquo;t an easy change - but that secondly, you need to always keep in the back of your mind that this relationship is as strong as you believe it to be, so don&rsquo;t ever lose faith.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>8.&nbsp;You&rsquo;ll get questioned&hellip;a lot</strong><br />Forget his parents or my parents questioning his success &ndash; so many friends and peers alone still question and look at me in disbelief when I tell them my boyfriend is working on a startup. Perhaps people don&rsquo;t understand it, or perhaps people just don't believe in it &ndash; but that&rsquo;s okay, not everyone will understand. As long as you believe in him, that&rsquo;s all there really is to keep the both of you going strong.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>9.&nbsp;You&rsquo;ll have to understand it never really ends</strong><br />I once asked him, &ldquo;Charlie, if your startup fails&hellip;what are you going to do?&rdquo;. Without any hesitation, he immediately responded, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going do another startup.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s when it hit me that my entrepreneur was here to stay. This is his one true dream, his one true passion &ndash; and I should never expect him to lose that. Instead of trying to convince him otherwise, you need to realize that by being there to support him along the way is one of the best things you could ever give him. His dream is that beaming ray of sunshine &ndash; but you&rsquo;re the ground beneath him, providing him support every step along the way.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>10. You&rsquo;ll need to remember that his love for you won&rsquo;t ever change </strong><br />Never forget the most important thing that brought the relationship together: the love you both share. Despite how busy and hectic his life is, his love for you will never change. I had a hard time grasping this when Charlie&rsquo;s work life became busier and busier &ndash; I started to doubt his love and had the constant fear that he would love interest in me because we had less time to spend together. However, I&rsquo;ve come to realize that not only am I his girlfriend, I&rsquo;m also his support system. He turns to me when things get rough and expects me to be the one smiling at him at the end of the day when all else fails. As much as I need him, he also needs me. Running a startup is no easy task, and he&rsquo;ll need me during his moments of despair. No matter how tough the times or how far the distance, I have to remember that unlike the uncertainties of a startup &ndash; his love for me will never, ever change.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />&#8203;</div>

(Mind you, the legal drinking age is 18 in Montreal and 19 in rest of Canada.)&nbsp;<br /><br />8. You get away with using student discounts for the next 5 years following your graduation.&nbsp;<br /><br />7. People give you weirded-out looks as soon as you mention anything relating to your &ldquo;job&rdquo; or &ldquo;work&rdquo;.&nbsp;<br /><br />6. Strangers making conversation with you ask where you go to high school, and you respond by saying you've graduated University.&nbsp;<br /><br />5. People often mistaken your significant other as your older brother, and in some cases, your dad.&nbsp;<br /><br />4.&nbsp;You get told to tie up your hair for job interviews in an attempt to make yourself look more mature.&nbsp;<br />&#8203;<br />3. You don&rsquo;t ever feel embarrassed walking through the &ldquo;Teen&rdquo; section of a bookstore while casually picking up a few books to read along the way.&nbsp;<br /><br />2.&nbsp;You get consoled by others saying how great you&rsquo;ll look in comparison 30 years from now when everyone else has white hair and wrinkles.&nbsp;<br /><br />1.&nbsp;<a href="https://scontent-ord1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/12049724_10156175907110068_7293204985622278206_n.jpg?oh=a1f80459257b2054c7d8b603c68e2ed2&amp;oe=5687CAF2"><u>This app</u>&nbsp;</a>blatantly says so.&#8203;&#8203;&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />&#8203;</div>
